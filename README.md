# Create Computing

 We are now living in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. One of the emerging technologies in 4th Industrial Revoltion is IoT or IT technologies. IoT refers to a technology that connects to the Internet by embedding sensors and communication functions in various objects or a service that uses them to provide them. I have been using it  without understanding the principles of IoT that I have been using. In addition, I had an abstract idea that it would be nice to incorporate IoT technology into a product only in my head.  When I used the Arduino Kit this time, I realized that if I used Arduino to my idea, I can easily tested out what I imagined in my head. Arduino is hardware that can create objects and interact with the environment by accepting input values from various switches or sensors and controlling output to electronic devices such as LEDs and motors. It was unfamiliar when I first saw Arduino, but as I learned step by step from the basic stage, I was able to quickly understand the principle of Arduino's movement and make something simple.

# Simulating Arduino

First, I explored how the circuit is configured by pressing the switch and turning on the LED.
I took one step further to understand the light sensor in more detail.

 To explore the light sensor in more detail, I made a light that lights up when it's dark.
I put Arduino's 5V and GND to the Breadboard. And then, I put the light sensor on the breadboard and one leg of the light sensor  connected to the 5V through a 10k ohm resistance. I connected resistance leg to A0 and the other leg of the resistance  connected to the GND. Next, LED was  plugged into the breadboard and a 330 ohm resistor was connected between the + legs and 5V of the LED. And the LED's -leg was connected to Arduino GND. Through the Arduino sketch program, I explored the level of light sensor comes in.

 I learned the basics of coding by referring to YouTube and various sites. It was really fun, and I wanted to record the codes I learned, share them with people, get feedback, and learn various coding sources made by others. So I created a community site called 'Coding Studio' where I can share and share the coding knowledge I have acquired. The purpose of this site is to share codes, create open sources, and communicate with each other. I only know the basic part of coding, so I haven't created a complete site yet, but I want to create such a site in the future.
